**Restman** is a command-line tool written in Python, designed to combine the simplicity of cURL with the powerful features of Postman. It aims to relieve users from the complexities of manually building network connections with URLs or endpoints, allowing them to focus solely on the core aspects of HTTP requests and responses. With Restman, users can quickly and efficiently test APIs, handle different HTTP methods, and parse response data without worrying about the underlying connection mechanics.
